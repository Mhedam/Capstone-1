  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> Creativity has always been a big part of my life, and I dream of combining my interest in people and my passion for creating something new and inspiring, to find my next job. </p>

    <p>For the past 10 years I have worked with HR. I have enjoyed working with people and helping them find their potential.

    <p>But in my spare time I live out my creative side through music and theatre, two passions that have followed me for many years.</p>
  
    <p>In addition, I have also experimented with creating websites in WordPress, and developed some individual websites - without knowing the underlying coding. It has given me a taste of what is possible to build digitally and it has inspired me to delve deeper into the technology.</p>
